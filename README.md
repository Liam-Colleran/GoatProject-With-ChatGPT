# GoatProject-With-ChatGPT ðŸ¤–
Turning simple GOAT web-scraping script into a website using ChatGPT.

**Overview:**
For this project I took a simple python script called GoatProject (which I have
uploaded in a previous repository) and used ChatGPT to turn it into a fully
functional website that implements the code I have written.

**How to install & Use:**
To install this project, install the app.py and place it in a new directory. Then,
in the same directory, make a folder called templates and in this folder install and
place the index.html file. Make sure to install all required libraries, which are, 
flask, requests, json, math, and contextlib. Finally follow the steps in the
Instructions.txt file to view and use the website.

**How this was made:** 
After I created my GoatProject.py file I wanted some way to turn it into a simple website
so I tried to do some research on how, but I did not have enough knowledge on html and flask
to make it work. I went to ChatGPT and it gave me very in depth responses on how to make it
work. It didnt work the first time so I fed it the error and it gave me a perfect response
on what to do. I will link the conversation below.
